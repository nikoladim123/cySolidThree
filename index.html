Depending on the complexity, developers of different skill levels are needed to code and create an enterprise level or a web based application. Once the application is built, a content management system would allow multiple administrators and users, with different permission levels to collaborate, create, manage, edit, archive and publish articles or other digital content. A CMS-based application may not be suited for each and every business model, but once it is put together professionally, it could offer many advantages such as cost, management and security.</p>

                  <p>For blogging and for personal use with small content type, WordPress is well suited and unsurpassed. For larger corporate websites and eCommerce sites however, one may want to consider its limited architecture, security vulnerabilities and the need for systematic changes which would increase the building cost substantially.
